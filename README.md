# OctopusLab

Our goal is to make easier work with basic development of electronics devices.

Our goals are not simple. We want to connect electronics, IoT and robotics with virual reality and AI. Because we cant end with "LED blinking", we need to go faster. For more effective coding we have libraries and modules.

## Development boards with code
There are multiple development boards what we support now. All of them are bellow.
- <a href=https://github.com/octopusengine/octopuslab/tree/master/esp8266>ESP8266</a> - NodeMcu (LoLin) / WeMos and octopus ESP-interface-board 
- <a href=https://github.com/octopusengine/octopuslab/tree/master/esp32-micropython/_examples/esp8266-examples>ESP8266 - Micropython</a> - NodeMcu (LoLin) / WeMos and octopus ESP-interface-board 
- <a href=https://github.com/octopusengine/octopuslab/tree/master/esp32>ESP32 - Arduino IDE-C</a> - octopusLAB ESP-interface/ROBOTboard
- <a href=https://github.com/octopusengine/octopuslab/tree/master/esp32-micropython>ESP32 - Micropython</a> - octopusLAB ESP-interface/ROBOTboard
- Raspberry Pi 2/3/ZERO
- Cortex M0/M3
- <a href=https://github.com/octopusengine/octopuslab/tree/master/attiny>Attiny</a> 85/45/13
- <a href=https://github.com/octopusengine/octopuslab/tree/master/arduino-nano>Arduino</a> (Nano)

If you want to reduce time you need for development use our new library for Arduino IDE: https://github.com/TomasRoj/OctopusLab-Library Thanks!
