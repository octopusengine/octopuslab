# OctopusLab - ESP32

This set of modules was created between 2016 and 2022 for ESP32 with MicroPython.
Version 1.16 (2021) was optimal and we tried to keep up until version 1.19 (2022).
Since version 1.20 (2023), new libraries are already being created here:

## OctopusLab - hackerspace

Our goal is to make easier work with basic development of electronics devices.

Our goals are not simple. We want to connect electronics, IoT and robotics with virual reality and AI. Because we cant end with "LED blinking", we need to go faster. For more effective coding we have libraries and modules.

## Development boards with code
There are multiple development boards what we support now. All of them are bellow.
- <a href=https://github.com/octopusengine/esp8266-arduinoC>ESP8266</a> - NodeMcu (LoLin) / WeMos and octopus ESP-interface-board
